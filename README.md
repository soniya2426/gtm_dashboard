# Interactive GTM Analytics Dashboard (Streamlit)

This project is an interactive data analytics dashboard built using **Streamlit** for academic and research purposes.  
The dashboard supports exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, segmentation, and perceptual mapping to support **Go-To-Market (GTM)** strategy development.

The primary dataset focuses on **packaged bottled water consumption in the UAE (200 respondents)**, with an additional dataset included for comparative brand analysis.

## Project Objectives

The dashboard is designed to:

- Explore consumer demographics and purchase behavior  
- Analyze key decision drivers using correlation and regression  
- Segment consumers using data-driven clustering (STP framework)  
- Visualize consumer perception using perceptual mapping  
- Support hypothesis-driven marketing and strategy research

   - Purchase frequency and behavior  
   - Brand awareness and brand choice  
   - Importance ratings for decision drivers (Likert scale)

2. **estee_lauder-dataset_50.xlsx**
